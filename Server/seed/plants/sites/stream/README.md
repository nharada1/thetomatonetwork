# Dynamic Dashboard With ChartJS

Today we will be creating a dynamic dashboard with live charts through the power of ChartJS. ChartJS is a powerful, dependency free JavaScript library that builds graphs via the canvas element. Best of all, it's easy for designers to get up and running. Today, we will focus on the pieces of the library that get you up and running with beautiful and functional charts *fast*. We will build a mobile-friendly dashboard from start to finish.
